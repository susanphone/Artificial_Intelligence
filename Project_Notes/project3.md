* Exact Class
    * algorithm
    * test records


* Approximate Class
    * algorithm - gibbs sampling/variable elimination
    * test records


* Main Class
    * store results - results from each algorithm on each networ (10 results)
    * initialize different parameters


* Reader Class
    * read in networks by common data structure
        * reading if file
        * storing it into data structure
            * variables and probability separately


* Helper Function Class
    * extra variables
