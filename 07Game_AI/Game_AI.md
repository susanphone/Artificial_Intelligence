* Unpredictable
* what are the possibilities my opponent might do, and plan for each
* time limits - need to approximate, limit the resources
* Plan of attack
    * perfect play
    * finite horizon, approximate eval
    * pruning reduce cost

## Non-Cooperative Games
* non-empty set, P, of players

## Constant-Sum Games
* if there exists a constant
* zero-sum is when the constant is zero
