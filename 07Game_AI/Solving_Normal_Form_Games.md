# Solving Normal Form Games
## Solving Games
* goal: maximize payoff
* p is that player
* s||dp is unilateral defection, the change is a defection and unilateral because only one player changed it
## Nash Equilibrium Point
* admissible for a given player if for all possible unilateral defections it has a cost. defecting would make matters worse
* Nash eqilibrium is that situation is admissible for all players. no one would want to change their mind
* what if equilibrium points is empty?
    * defined over the set of pure strategies, and can occur in this case. SO move to mixed strategies
## Mixed Strategies
* assign prob dist to all strategies
* expanded strategies are mixtures
## Two THeorems
* Theorem 1: every finite normal form has a mixed nash
* Theorem 2: finite game of perfect information has a pure strategy equilibrium point (Zermelo)
    * This handles extensive-form games
## Solving Matrix Games
* confessing would mean fewer years regardless of the other players choice, admissible
## Identifying the Equilibrium
* Dominance- multiple solutions where one is not always better than the other, but if it is, then its dominant
## Dominant Strategy
* can still have weak dominance in equilibrium
## Dominance Solvable
## An Economic Game
* two publishers, decide what lead story will be
* two events, a presidential scandal and proposal to deploy us force to Granada
* Which story should they run
* Maximum is what dominates
