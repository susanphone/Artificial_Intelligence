# Chaining

## Logical Inference
## Forward Chaining
## Backward Chaining

### Converting to Clause Form
1. Eliminate implications
2. reduce scope of negation symbols
3. Standardize variables
    * Watch out for scopes
4. Eliminate existential quantifiers
    * Skolem Constants/Functions
5. Move universal quantifiers left
    * prenex form
    * all variables are unique to each universal quantifier
6. Rewrite in conjunctive normal form
    * Uses Distributive law
7. Eliminate universal quantifiers
    * all variables are assumed to be universally quantified
8. Separate into Clauses
    * this amounts to AND-elimination
9. Rename variables
    * no variable symbol should appear in more than one clause
