# Background and History
Field of AI began ~1940's
## 1943-1956
* McCullough & Pitts/Hebb
simple nueral models of processing
gradient descent and hebbian learning
    hebbian learning: if neurons match increase weight, else decrease weight
        this starts neuro-nets
* Shannon/Turing
    Computers can manipulate symbols
    chess as a canonical example
    
    * Turing Test: Agent in a room, and a person with a teletype outside the roon, connected to that room. The person talks to the agent
        If you can't tell the difference, the test passes
        * Obersational Equivalence: It appears to be what you think it is. 
* Dartmouth Conference 1956
    genesis of the term "AI"
    No problems were solved during the conference
    The field of AI was born
* Newell & Simon
    * Logic Theorist: A system that can prove simple logical problems.
        There was hope
### How do we train the network?

## 1952-1969
* General Prolem Solver
    Generalization of Logic Theorist
    Attempts to solve like humans
* Samuel Checkers Program
    Used learning to improve performance
    Early reinforcement learning
* LISP language 1958/ Time Sharing/ Advice Taker (McCarthy)
    Standard language for AI language
* Minsky Micro-Worlds
    The hackers (or scruffies) vs the neats
    Different types of problems (Toy problems)
* Resolution Method Invented
    backward chaining and bases of prolog(declaritive language)

## 1966-1974
* Realizing the limits of "Syntax" (Weak Methods)
    What is a notion of "meaning" beyond symbols?
    There is a disconnect between syntactic methods and biological methods
* Ubiquity of the Combinatorics
    Every problem seems to hit a dead-end
    Problems are computationally intractable (AI = Solving NP-COmplete problems)
        Symbolic
        Connectionist
* The (in)famous Perceptron Paper
* Inital signs of the AI Winter emerge

## 1969-1979
* Expert Systems
    Dendral, Prospector, MYCIN
* Formalism for "Knowledge"
    Reaction to the problems of syntax
* Recognition of Need to Understand Uncertainty
    MYCIN uncertainty factors as a heuristic
* Shakey the Robot
    Highly Successful in a limited micro-world
### Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck

## 1980-1988
* Expert Systems Engineering
    R1 at DEC
* LISP Machines Developed
* Industrial Vision Takes Hold
* Hilare Robot Performs Mappign and Planning in Real World
* Japanese 5th Generation Project
    In 10 years the AI problem would be solved
* The Return of Neural Networks
### Backpropagation: start at the output and work to the input

## 1990 - present
* Formal Methods of the Fore
    Inductive Logic Programming(Declarative Methods)
    Probablistic Graphical Models
    ### Basian Network: Graph Theory and Probability to do what rules do
* AI Dilution
    Many Systems need just a "little" AI combined with solid CS
    Need to take a "systems" view
* AI Maturity
    Where did all those hackers go?
    There are now degrees in artificial intelligence
* The "Advent" of Big Data
* Deep Learning
