# Bayes Decision Theory
* Agent is trying to decide between two things
    A1 A2
* Which is the best one, which is the right choice
* Agent has available evidence 

## Bayesian Risk
* Loss function - when you don't make the right choice

greek lambda $\lambda$

Utility function: probabily of right choice times the loss of the wrong choice

## Minimizing Risk
* Find the last term using Bayes rule
* Make a choice that minimizes the risk

## Decision Rule
* Substitute
* Rearrange terms
* Bayes rule, denominators cancel out
* Right 0, wrong 1

## Expected Monetary Value

## Multiattribute Utility Theory
## Dominance
### Stochastic Dominance
* if you know distribution and you know the cost, you can figure out whiich one dominates
